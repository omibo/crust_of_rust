# Crust of Rust

This project contains implementations of fundamental Rust concepts, inspired by Jon Gjengset's [live coding sessions](https://www.youtube.com/c/JonGjengset). It serves as a deep dive into Rust's core features and standard library components.

## Components

### 1. Function Traits and Closures
Implementation and exploration of Rust's function traits and closure mechanics.

### 2. Custom Iterator Implementation
A custom implementation of iterators similar to Rust's standard library, demonstrating iterator behavior and internals.

### 3. Lifetime Management
Examples and implementations showcasing Rust's lifetime system and memory safety guarantees.

### 4. Smart Pointers
Custom implementation of smart pointer types, similar to those found in Rust's standard library (`Box`, `RefCell`, etc.).

## Acknowledgments
This project follows the excellent educational content provided by Jon Gjengset through his YouTube channel and live coding sessions.
